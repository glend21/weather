Extrapolate rain radar images to estimate short-term projections

General status notes (to my future self):

- the TVL1 algo with default params is there but is running excessively long
- as above, but then it crashes
- the Farneback algo with fixed params produces a SSIM score of ~ 64% - 74% (very limited testing)
- interestingly, the similarity score steadily decreases along an image set. I don't think I'm doing
    anything silly, like comparing all generated images to the first. This could be an interesting
    bug to track down.

- need a method of determing the beest parameter set of n dimensions, without just circling the drain.
    the brute-force approach is too expensive (and ugly)

- visually, the generated images using Farneback (standard caveat -- limited testing) are almost usable
